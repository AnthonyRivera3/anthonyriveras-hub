  <h3>About me:</h3>
<p><i>
For starter's my name is Anthony Rivera I am sure you already know that based off of the title of my page. I am in my junior year of collge going for my bachelor's in computer science. The more I move up in my major the more I realize I cant escape math. Currently I am taking calc 2, hopefully its not challenging because math is not my strong suit. I could only dream for it to not be challenging. The only coding language Im very familar with is C++. I know a little bit about python and some C. I do plan on learning a lot about HTML and I am having a lot of fun writing the code for my page in HTML so with that being said so far so good. Other than school and work I enjoy watching anime, going to the gym and playing video games every once and a while.
